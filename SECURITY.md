# Security Policy

Thank you for helping us keep the Game Data Exchange (GDX) Protocol and any systems it interacts with secure.

## Reporting Security Issues

The GDX Protocol project is maintained by [Rocket Science](https://www.rocketscience.gg).

The security of our systems and user data is our top priority. We appreciate the work of security researchers acting in good faith in identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities.
